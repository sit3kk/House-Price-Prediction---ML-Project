# 🏠 House-Price-Prediction-ML-Project 🏠

## 📝 About the Project
This is a simple machine learning project that was created to enhance understanding of Python’s ML tools and the prediction process. I used Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models and achieved 82% accuracy in my predictions.

🔗 The dataset I used can be found here: Kaggle Dataset
